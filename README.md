# üéÆ Game Success Predictor
This is the first integrated project as part of TripleTen's Data Science program. It focuses on analyzing and predicting the success of video games using advanced data analysis techniques. The primary objectives are to deliver accurate success predictions, support decision-making in the gaming industry, and optimize marketing and development strategies.

## üöÄ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing video game sales and metadata for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations in the gaming industry.
- **Feature Engineering**: Customizing features to enhance prediction accuracy for game success.
- **Region Analysis**: Analyzing game performance across different geographic regions to uncover regional preferences.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Validating assumptions about factors influencing game success using statistical methods.
- **Business Insights**: Providing actionable recommendations for game development and marketing strategies based on data-driven findings. 

## üìä Visuals

This project includes a variety of visualizations to support data-driven insights:

- **Sales Trends**: Line and bar charts showing sales performance over time and across regions.
- **Genre Popularity**: Pie and bar charts illustrating the distribution of game genres.
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Visual representations of relationships between key features.
- **Model Performance**: Plots comparing predicted vs. actual values and visualizing error metrics.
- **Regional Analysis**: Maps and charts highlighting differences in game success by region.

All visuals are generated within the Jupyter Notebook and can be customized for further exploration. 

This visual illustrates the total sales trends for the top five gaming platforms across the years. It highlights how each platform's popularity and market share have changed over time, providing insights into industry shifts and consumer preferences.

This visual explores the life cycle of each gaming platform represented in the dataset. By analyzing the release and discontinuation periods, as well as sales trends over time, we can identify when platforms were most active and popular. Understanding these cycles helps contextualize game performance and market dynamics across different generations of gaming hardware.

The dataset originally covers video game data from 1980 to 2016. However, to ensure that predictions for 2017 are based on the most relevant trends, the data has been filtered to include only entries from 2012 to 2016.
